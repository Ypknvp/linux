The steps you've outlined to download, extract, and run code from the GitHub repositories on a Linux machine are well-structured and should work efficiently. Here's a quick recap and a few additional details you might find helpful:

### 1. **Install `curl` (if necessary)**
   If `curl` is not already installed, you can install it by running:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install curl
   ```

### 2. **Download the ZIP Files**
   Use the `curl` command to download the repositories as ZIP files:
   ```bash
   curl -L -o hapdoop.zip https://github.com/Ypknvp/hapdoop/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
   curl -L -o openmp.zip https://github.com/Ypknvp/openmp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
   ```

### 3. **Extract the ZIP Files**
   After downloading, use `unzip` to extract the files:
   ```bash
   unzip hapdoop.zip
   unzip openmp.zip
   ```
   If `unzip` isn't installed, you can install it:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install unzip
   ```

### 4. **Navigate to the Extracted Directories**
   Change to the appropriate directory:
   ```bash
   cd hapdoop-main
   cd ../openmp-main
   ```

### 5. **Run the Code**
   After navigating to the repository, check for a README file or any documentation on how to run the code. Depending on the project, you may need to run commands like:

   - For Python projects:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
     or install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - For C/C++ projects:
     Compile with `gcc` or `make`:
     ```bash
     gcc -o program program.c
     ./program
     ```

### 6. **Clean Up (Optional)**
   If you no longer need the ZIP files, you can delete them to free up space:
   ```bash
   rm hapdoop.zip openmp.zip
   ```

These steps should ensure a smooth process for downloading, extracting, and running the code from the repositories. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
